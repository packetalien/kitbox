# KitBox

**KitBox** is a web-based equipment management tool designed for tabletop roleplaying games, with a focus on GURPS but adaptable to other systems. Organize your adventurer's gear with an intuitive interface, featuring a parchment-themed design, a paperdoll for character equipment placement, and support for containers like backpacks and belts. Whether you're tracking a sword's weight or stashing potions in a saddlebag, KitBox streamlines your inventory management.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Gear Tracking**: Manage equipment with details like name, description, weight, cost, value, and legality.
- **Interactive Paperdoll**: Assign gear to body slots (e.g., head, hands) or containers via a graphical character interface.
- **Container Management**: Open backpacks, belts, or saddlebags to organize nested items.
- **Parchment Aesthetic**: A thematic, parchment-style UI for an immersive RPG experience.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Seamlessly switch between the master gear list, paperdoll, and container views with robust state management.
- **Flexible Design**: Optimized for GURPS but adaptable to any tabletop RPG system.
